# Facebook-page-automation
 Facebook Automation is a Python application that allows you to post messages and images to Facebook. It is a simple and easy-to-use application that can be used by anyone, regardless of their programming experience.  The application is divided into two main parts: the user interface and the backend. The user interface is a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows you to enter the page ID, access token, and post message. The backend is a Python module that uses the Facebook Graph API to post the message and images to Facebook.  The application is still under development, but it is already functional. I am planning to add more features to the application in the future, such as the ability to upload multiple images at once, schedule posts to be published at a later date, and integrate with other social media platforms.
